## Introduction
KGNS is a new recommendation framework for long tail recommendations. KGNS is based on the graph neural network framework, which expands the long tail interest of users and enhances the long tail item representation using co-occurrence graphs to provide high-quality recommendations.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.10. The required packages are as follows:
* torch == 1.8.0
* numpy == 1.23.5
* pandas == 1.5.3
* scipy == 1.10.1
* tqdm == 4.65.0
* scikit-learn == 1.2.2

## KGNS operation steps
1. run selector.py to generate Long-tail Neighbors
~~~
python selector.py
~~~
2. run doCooccur.py to construct Co-occurrence graph and merge Co-occurrence graph and KG
~~~
python doCooccur.py
~~~
3. start KGNS
~~~
python main_KGNS.py
~~~

## Ablation study
### Base
1. Replace the training set from longtail_log_.txt to train.txt, and longtail_log_.txt is generated by selector.py, please do not replace data_ Line 22 of the data_loader.py file, which is used to calculate evaluation metrics
2. Replace the knowledge graph file from kg_ Replace kg_final2.txt to kg_final.txt(set on line 24 of the data_loader.py), and kg_final2.txt is generated by doCooccur.py
3. Run code 'python main_KGNS.py' to start Base

### KGNS-UN
1. Replace the knowledge graph file from kg_ Replace kg_final2.txt to kg_final.txt(set on line 24 of the data_loader.py)
2. Run code 'python main_KGNS.py' to start KGNS-UN

### KGNS-IN
1. Replace the training set from longtail_log_.txt to train.txt (set on line 21 of the data_loader.py)
2. Run code 'python main_KRALR.py' to start KGNS-IN


## datasets
We provided two datasets to validate KGNS: Last-FM and MovieLens-1M, the former obtained from KGAT, and the latter is a version released by MovieLens-1M. The following table shows the information of two datasets:

|                | Last-FM |MovieLens-1M|
| :------------: | :-----: |  :-----:   |
|    n_users     |  23566  |    6040    |
|    n_items     |  48123  |    3655    |
| n_interactions | 3034796 |   997579   |
|   n_entities   | 58266  |   398505   |
|  n_relations   |    9    |     57     |
|   n_triples    | 464567  |   3396595  |

Besides the user-item interactions, we need to construct item knowledge for each dataset. For Last-FM, we mapped items to Freebase entities. For MovieLens-1M, we employed Freebase to map movies in MovieLens-1M to construct KG.
The following table shows the KG information of Last-FM and MovieLens-1M:

| Knowledge Graph |   Freebase(Last-FM)   |  Freebase(MovieLens-1M)  |
|:---------------:|          :-----------:         |     :-------:     |
|   #entities    |              58266            |       398505      |
|   #relations   |                 9              |         57        |
|    #triples    |              464567            |       3396595     |
